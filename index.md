### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite because I remember doing a madlib project
    like this one back in high school for java. It was a lot of fun to revist
    something that I did a year ago. I loved relearning how to print in a new
    language and I also liked to learn how to declare because these really were
    the basics.
    
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I always liked blackjack and always
    wondered how I could get it to work by coding. This was good for me since
    I want to develop games in the future. I enjoyed being able to write functions 
    for the first time. I also enjoyed being able to set rules for a game I liked.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because I thought it was fun and easy thing 
    to do since it involved number. Using the average is always useful so making
    a program to do it for you is cool. I like using loops to make sure it would
    work. I also liked using store values in a double and float variable.
